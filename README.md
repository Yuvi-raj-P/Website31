hello! thanks for looking into the repository. This is a simple three js site that took me 34 hours to make. Yea, neither am I sure why it took me that long I have been stuck with the butterfly animation for so long. But finally, it's here, I am just getting started with JS as well while also trying to do three JSs so mistakes happen!

Models from sketchfab with modifications in blender. Used Desmos for trig animation visualization!
